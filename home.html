        <h1>About</h1>
        <h2>April E. Chilldres</h2>

        <p>From temp jobs as a teen, to college courses in my twenties, then came the Healthcare Sector. Registered Nursing school at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock for two plus years while working as a Patient Care Technician in a hospital.</p>

        <p>Everything I had done my whole life had left me with this empty feeling. Like no matter what I did, it just never felt right and I always found a way to sabotage myself. Being creative has always been a passion of mine since I was a young child and doing anything creative gives me this best rush, and feeling of complete happiness. I finally, at an older age I don't care to mention, I finally stopeed living for other people's happiness & chose to do things I wanted to do regardless of attaining approval from anyone. Since that time I have never been more at peace with my soul and a woman that lives her best life.Lorem ipsum,</p>
